<div class="verse00">If you can find, within, a single line</div>
<div class="verse00">To give you pleasure, then the pleasure's mine;</div>
<div class="verse00">But if you fail and whine, or <em>josh</em> like Billings,</div>
<div class="verse00">You might (I say you <em>might</em>!) get back your shillings.</div>
<div class="verse00">But better yet! Bestow this Book of Verses</div>
<div class="verse00">On some friend-foe you love with hate and curses,</div>
<div class="verse00">And your revenge will be attained thereafter</div>
<div class="verse00">For, when he reads it, he will die with laughter.</div>
<div class="verse00">And, Cheerful Reader, if this work contains</div>
<div class="verse00">A soporific for your bulging brains</div>
<div class="verse00">So that you'll <em>rave about it</em> to your neighbors,</div>
<div class="verse00">I'll feel repaid for all rebuffs and labors.</div>
<div class="verse00">Though "Wisdom sometimes borrows, sometimes lends,"</div>
<div class="verse00">You'll borrow trouble lending this to friends;</div>
<div class="verse00">But earn my thanks if, when you've praised or shown it,</div>
<div class="verse00">You'll sit upon the lid and never loan it:</div>
<div class="verse00">For ev'ry copy sold, thru friends or slapbacks,</div>
<div class="verse00">Just puts Mo'lasses on my buckwheat flapjacks.</div>
<div class="verse00">And, Critic Friend, who halts Ambition's flight</div>
<div class="verse00">And ties the can to Aspiration's kite,</div>
<div class="verse00">Pray recollect that when <em>you</em> plied the pen</div>
<div class="verse00">And had some stuff accepted now and then,</div>
<div class="verse00">Your tales, O! Henry, did not prove inviting</div>
<div class="verse00">Or else you'd be no Cynic but still writing.</div>

<div class="verse00">He seeks no conquest but his lance is set</div>
<div class="verse00">Against the ruthless Despot's parapet.</div>
<div class="verse00">Alert and conscious of his strength, his thrust</div>

<div class="verse00">Those who love Justice and respect the laws.</div>
<div class="verse00">To skulking traitors and to spying foes</div>
<div class="verse00">He shows no mercy, but his heart o'erflows</div>

<div class="verse00">The profits on the <em>die</em>-stuffs sent to France</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The almost-King of Verdun, still uncrowned,</div>
<div class="verse00">Wearied of <em>driving</em>, walked the ramparts 'round</div>
<div class="verse00">To see his father, Mr. William Kaiser,</div>
<div class="verse00">Who was to him an Oracle and wiser.</div>
<div class="verse00">"O Sire! Inform me! Tell your first-born son,</div>
<div class="verse00">Who caused the War, and why it was begun?</div>
<div class="verse00">Who slipped the leash, and what was the excuse</div>

<div class="verse00">Did you? Or was it Cousin George, or Nick</div>
<div class="verse00">Who stacked the cards and played the dirty trick?</div>
<div class="verse00">Or was it Joe, or Ferdinand, or Grey</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"My Son, I swear by all the periscopes</div>
<div class="verse00">And Zeppelins to which I pin my hopes;</div>
<div class="verse00">By all the Ocean Sharks and Bats a-sky,</div>
<div class="verse00">By Gott-in-Himmel! As I hope to die,</div>
<div class="verse00"><em>I'm</em> not to blame! I didn't use the spurs,</div>
<div class="verse00">Or try to overwork Geographers!</div>
<div class="verse00">I fought for Peace, and ne'er defiance hurled,</div>
<div class="verse00">Altho' the Fatherland <em>should</em> rule the world.</div>
<div class="verse00">But here's the truth: a secret I'll disclose!</div>
<div class="verse00">A stranger 'twas who made us come to blows!</div>
<div class="verse00">It happened thus: a mighty Nimrod came</div>
<div class="verse00">From Afric wilds, where he had played the game</div>
<div class="verse00">Until his cudgel bore a hundred nicks,</div>
<div class="verse00">(A record this for all Prodigious Sticks)</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><div class="verse00">To Germany. No pussyfoot was his,</div>
<div class="verse00">But there was courage in his Nobel phiz;</div>
<div class="verse00">And in his stride were energy and grace</div>
<div class="verse00">Enough to make the goose-step commonplace.</div>
<div class="verse00">I took him to my Palace, as my guest,</div>
<div class="verse00">And poured libations from the cellar's <em>best</em>,</div>
<div class="verse00">(He was a <em>certified</em> non-drinker&mdash;See?</div>
<div class="verse00">So just accord this proper secrecy!)</div>
<div class="verse00">And then arranged to hold a Grand Review</div>
<div class="verse00">Of all my Armies and Reservists too.</div>
<div class="verse00">'De-lighted!' said my guest, and nothing more,</div>
<div class="verse00">As we reviewed my legions corps by corps;</div>
<div class="verse00">But this blunt comment signified his zeal,</div>
<div class="verse00">And so I mobilized my fleet at Kiel;</div>
<div class="verse00">And on my Royal Yacht, my guest and I</div>
<div class="verse00">Watched the maneuvres as my ships passed by.</div>
<div class="verse00">'De-lighted, Bill!' the Hardy Hunter shouted&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse00">'With such a fleet I'd have the whole world routed;</div>
<div class="verse00">And with your armies I would soon disperse</div>
<div class="verse00">The Fighting Units of the Universe!'</div>
<div class="verse00">Such praise was pleasing to my ears, altho</div>
<div class="verse00">My Wasps and Devil-fish I didn't show:</div>
<div class="verse00">I deemed it best to <em>meld</em> this 'hundred aces'</div>
<div class="verse00">When all my ships and men were in their places.</div>
<div class="verse00">Had he seen <em>these</em>, I knew he would advise</div>
<div class="verse00">The conquest of the Earth and Seas and Skies:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><div class="verse00">But, Shades of Bismarck! <em>that</em>, you understand</div>
<div class="verse00">Might prove a strain upon the Fatherland.</div>
<div class="verse00">And so I kept the Peace, but thought about</div>
<div class="verse00">The many martial plans we figured out;</div>
<div class="verse00">And how the cost of my Frontier Defences</div>
<div class="verse00">Compared with his proposed campaign expenses.</div>
<div class="verse00">You see, Mein Heir, this man was full of guile</div>
<div class="verse00">And caused the War: this Bey of Oyster Isle.</div>
<div class="verse00">He hypnotized me: put it in my mind</div>
<div class="verse00">To be the Potentate of all Mankind!</div>
<div class="verse00">So blame me not! The fault I must disown,</div>
<div class="verse00">And put the guilt on Theodore alone!</div>
<div class="verse00">Whatever comes anon, I'm not whipped yet!</div>
<div class="verse00">And with it all, I have but one regret&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse00">That <em>he</em> was not impressed to lead my drive</div>
<div class="verse00">To Petersburg to take the Czar alive;</div>
<div class="verse00">And then, a Marshal, ordered to Paree</div>
<div class="verse00">To capture it and bring it back to me;</div>
<div class="verse00">Then take my fleet, the English Channel over</div>
<div class="verse00">And put King George to rout and bombard Dover;</div>
<div class="verse00">And then supplant the Sultan, take his Fez</div>
<div class="verse00">And lead my peerless Forces to Suez.</div>
<div class="verse00">While <em>you</em> have failed, and Hindenburg and Mack,</div>
<div class="verse00"><em>He</em> never fizzles when he makes attack.</div>
<div class="verse00">See what I've missed! for, <em>see what he has done</em>!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">And yet his vast campaign is just begun.</div>
<div class="verse00">He leads his Legions, Bull Moose, Calf and Cow</div>
<div class="verse00">To capture a Convention <em>even now</em>."</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">An orderly approached the Royal Pair</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Come, Comrades, gather 'round the festal board</div>
<div class="verse00">And quaff the sparkling Water from the gourd!</div>
<div class="verse00"><em>This</em> is the drink that Adam's Tribe imbibed</div>
<div class="verse00">Before the Wines of Gath were diatribed.</div>
<div class="verse00">(Methinks some other brand was drunk by Cain</div>
<div class="verse00">The day that Abel ruthlessly was slain.)</div>
<div class="verse00">And won, against all other potions there,</div>
<div class="verse00">The First White Ribbon at the Gaza Fair.</div>
<div class="verse00">You'll never know, until you take a sip</div>
<div class="verse00">Its power to soothe, and cool the fevered lip.</div>
<div class="verse00">Had Noah <em>stuck to</em> water he would shine</div>
<div class="verse00">As undisputed Master of the Brine.</div>
<div class="verse00">The Water-wagon that he launched, at first</div>
<div class="verse00">Steered Noah straight but didn't cure his thirst:</div>
<div class="verse00">So when he <em>spoke</em> the Ararat Caf&eacute;</div>
<div class="verse00">He soon fell off,&mdash;his rudder washed away.</div>
<div class="verse00">But wallward turn the picture you're beholding</div>
<div class="verse00">And hang more cheerful paintings on the moulding!</div>
<div class="verse00">Behold a <em>watercolor</em> of eclat!</div>
<div class="verse00">This, fair Rebecca had the skill to <em>draw</em>:</div>
<div class="verse00">She stands beside the well and plies the sweep,</div>
<div class="verse00">While sweat and blushes o'er her features creep.</div>
<div class="verse00">Such grace and poise, such strength and skill,</div>
<div class="verse00">Such sweeping gestures and unbending will</div>
<div class="verse00">Are indices of Abstinence complete;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">(We can't abstain from loving you, Petite!)</div>
<div class="verse00">Upon her head she rests the dripping urn</div>
<div class="verse00">And goes straight home: she doesn't <em>dare</em> to turn!</div>
<div class="verse00">Don't stumble, Miss! Or suffer teasing boys</div>
<div class="verse00">To cause derangement of your equipoise!</div>
<div class="verse00">But keep your head and waver not at all</div>
<div class="verse00">Lest you be deluged by the waterfall!</div>
<div class="verse00">So daily to the pool Rebecca strayed</div>
<div class="verse00">And drank the water, when she didn't wade:</div>
<div class="verse00">And thus her framework waxed like iron; I trust</div>
<div class="verse00">'Twas ne'er assailed or undermined by rust.</div>
<div class="verse00">So, fill the gourd and pass it to your friend!</div>
<div class="verse00">It's Safety First and safety to the end.</div>
<div class="verse00">No headaches lurk within, no tinge of sorrow,</div>
<div class="verse00">No dark forebodings or remorse to-morrow!</div>
<div class="verse00">And furthermore, it isn't hard to take:</div>
<div class="verse00">If you've not tried it, <em>do</em>, for Mercy's sake!</div>
<div class="verse00">Behold the Oaken Bucket, hanging high,</div>
<div class="verse00">By Bards and Singers lauded to the sky.</div>
<div class="verse00">It never touched, in all its useful days,</div>
<div class="verse00">A thing but water. Here fair Psyche plays</div>
<div class="verse00">Beside the spring that mirrors all her graces.</div>
<div class="verse00">(Would you object to <em>water in</em> such cases?)</div>
<div class="verse00">Now mark the fate befalling Jack and Jill</div>
<div class="verse00">Because they slipped and let the water spill;</div>
<div class="verse00">And see poor Tantalus for water crying,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">Thus punished for his sins,&mdash;athirst and dying!</div>
<div class="verse00">And note this "Titian," called "The Drunkard's Fate,"</div>
<div class="verse00">In which the crimson hues predominate.</div>
<div class="verse00">He holds the lamp-post in his close embrace</div>
<div class="verse00">And has a package from Pat Murphy's place</div>
<div class="verse00">To carry home. His eyes are red and dim,</div>
<div class="verse00">So close the bar and turn the hose on him!</div>
<div class="verse00">This drink was ever priceless, yet it's free;</div>
<div class="verse00">The Source and Fountain of Sobriety;</div>
<div class="verse00">And so we offer without bar or price</div>
<div class="verse00">Enough of <span class="smcap">THIS</span> to put your thirst on ice.</div>
<div class="verse00">So drink to <span class="smcap">WATER</span>, while the billows swell:</div>

<div class="verse00">Shall Women vote or be kept on probation?</div>
<div class="verse00">Are they not gentle, honest, sweet and kind?</div>
<div class="verse00">A single missing virtue we can't find,</div>

<div class="verse00">You're far too frail and fine for statecraft worries!</div>
<div class="verse00">The Sacred Home for you! Just 'tend your chicks!</div>

<div class="verse00">Will make our future course a thorny path:</div>
<div class="verse00">Unless we meet her fairly in these matters,</div>
<div class="verse00">She'll tear our senseless arguments to tatters,</div>
<div class="verse00">And rule <em>both</em> Home and State to suit herself,</div>
<div class="verse00">Putting deceitful <em>man</em> upon the shelf.</div>
<div class="verse00">As sure as death or taxes, day or night,</div>
<div class="verse00">She'll have the <em>vote</em> without, or <em>with</em> a fight;</div>
<div class="verse00">And those of us who counsel Peace, as best,</div>

<div class="verse00">They'll take a punch, or sip a little claret,</div>
<div class="verse00">But when it comes to liquor&mdash;they can't bear it.</div>

<div class="verse00">Shall men surrender to the petticoat</div>
<div class="verse00">And give up all their freedom and their tipples</div>

<div class="verse00">And save our striplings from the slough and slime.</div>
<div class="verse00">Why <em>shouldn't</em> Women vote? Perhaps they may!</div>
<div class="verse00">Should Drunkards or Illiterates say nay?</div>
<div class="verse00">Could citizens of foreign birth refuse</div>
<div class="verse00">To give our Native Daughters what they choose?</div>
<div class="verse00">Our Native Sons with chivalry invoke</div>
<div class="verse00">Fair play for women,&mdash;freedom from the yoke;</div>
<div class="verse00">And shouldn't other Freemen rise in flocks</div>

<div class="verse00">The trouble lies, not <em>here</em>, but with the Bosses</div>
<div class="verse00">Who trade in graft and deal in <em>double crosses</em>.</div>
<div class="verse00">The sooner we eliminate this class</div>
<div class="verse00">The quicker will <em>full freedom</em> come to pass.</div>
<div class="verse00">But watch the Anti! Make her hold her tongue,</div>

<div class="verse00">Or lock her in the booth, without a mirror,</div>
<div class="verse00">Where she can't see herself and we can't hear her.</div>
<div class="verse00">Thus, neck and neck, these two great questions lead:</div>
<div class="verse00">Will men be equal to their Country's need?</div>
<div class="verse00">If one Reform upon the other waits,</div>
<div class="verse00">Speed Equal Suffrage to the White House gates,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><div class="verse00">And Prohibition (Farewell, Dear old Liquor!)</div>

<blockquote><p>Newspaper Item, Athens, Pa., July 29: The archaeologists
who are traversing the Susquehanna River Valley,
visiting sites of Indian villages and digging up
aborigines and other relics, are said to have made a
most astounding discovery on the Murray farm, near
here, in finding the bones of sixty-eight pre-historic men.
The average height of these men when their skeletons
were assembled was seven feet, while many were much
taller. Additional evidence of their gigantic size is
found in the massive stone battle axes in their graves.
The average age of these men is said to have been from
thirty to forty. Another amazing point of this discovery
is the allegation that "perfectly formed skulls were found
from which horns grew straight out from the head."</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Ben Franklin was a Jester of the sort</div>
<div class="verse00">That fused, with wit, rare wisdom in retort;</div>
<div class="verse00">And, on his mettle, tempered by a smile</div>
<div class="verse00">His irony could hold them <em>all</em> awhile.</div>
<div class="verse00">King Louis' Court to impotence made plea</div>
<div class="verse00">Before the onslaughts of his repartee.</div>
<div class="verse00">His well-aimed jibes were quite as hard to dodge</div>
<div class="verse00">As meteors agleam with persiflage.</div>
<div class="verse00">His oily tongue worked on a swinging swivel,</div>
<div class="verse00">For he <em>spat out</em> his thoughts and didn't drivel.</div>
<div class="verse00">The Quakers, in his absence, had attacks</div>
<div class="verse00">Of blues, because they missed his almanacs;</div>
<div class="verse00">And Frenchmen soon began to understand</div>
<div class="verse00">And praise his jokes (in England contraband).</div>
<div class="verse00">He said to Louis, "Sire, the skies are down;</div>
<div class="verse00">I wouldn't give a Fillip for your crown."</div>
<div class="verse00">And added, "Nay, I wouldn't give a sou!</div>
<div class="verse00">There's just one Philip, but sixteen of you!"</div>
<div class="verse00">He had no fear, you see, of raining Kings,</div>
<div class="verse00">And, with umbrella raised, enjoyed his flings.</div>
<div class="verse00">Such pointed puns <em>disfavor</em> oft beget,</div>
<div class="verse00">But Louis laughed and so did Lafayette.</div>
<div class="verse00">Tho galley slave, like creatures of his type,</div>
<div class="verse00">He broke his chains, when Freedom's plans were ripe,</div>
<div class="verse00">And put the U. S. A. upon the chart,</div>
<div class="verse00">Allied to France, thru diplomatic art.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span><div class="verse00">To-day Ben Bolt, who clipped the lion's claws,</div>
<div class="verse00">For lightning work gets thunderous applause.</div>
<div class="verse00">The thunderbolts obeyed at his command,</div>
<div class="verse00">And currents, insubordinate, were canned.</div>
<div class="verse00">He kept the Upper Regions on the string</div>
<div class="verse00">And shocked the Lower World like everything.</div>
<div class="verse00">All praise to Franklin, Diplomatic Star!</div>
<div class="verse00">He went where he was sent, but not <em>too far</em>:</div>
<div class="verse00">And tho he flew his mortal kite so high,</div>
<div class="verse00">Poor Richard's name illuminates the sky.</div>

<h2><a id="THE_PHILOSOPHY_OF_LIVING">THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIVING</a></h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">We bivouac here and barely get acquainted</div>
<div class="verse00">Until the furlough ends; then we are sainted,</div>
<div class="verse00">Whether our acts deserve rebuke or praise.</div>
<div class="verse00">When we are <em>dead</em> the recollection stays</div>
<div class="verse00">Of virtues only: vices are excused,</div>
<div class="verse00">But to the <em>living</em> pardon is refused.</div>
<div class="verse00">And yet, alive, I'd rather be unsung,</div>
<div class="verse00">Than any Saint the catacombs among.</div>
<div class="verse00">Tho critics flay me and the censors sneer,</div>
<div class="verse00">'Twere better so, than praises on my bier.</div>
<div class="verse00">And so we walk life's slender rope till, bing!</div>
<div class="verse00">We slip and fall or someone cuts the string.</div>
<div class="verse00">Ambition lures us, but the pinkest peach</div>
<div class="verse00">Is always just beyond us, out of reach:</div>
<div class="verse00">And when, at last, we think we are in line</div>
<div class="verse00">To cross the threshold, lo! the Full House sign.</div>
<div class="verse00">We never quite obtain the golden urn</div>
<div class="verse00">Tho rainbows beckon every way we turn.</div>
<div class="verse00">Who ever found, I ask you, all he sought?</div>
<div class="verse00">Our best endeavors ofttimes come to naught:</div>
<div class="verse00">And yet we trudge along, loath to confess</div>
<div class="verse00">We're only groping in a wilderness;</div>
<div class="verse00">Plodding the sands that burn our feet, and hurt;</div>
<div class="verse00">Seeking the Promised Land, our just desert.</div>
<div class="verse00">Had C&aelig;sar reached the zenith of his life</div>
<div class="verse00">When Brutus cut his friendship with the knife?</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">The ladder broke and he was headlong flung</div>
<div class="verse00">While setting foot upon the topmost rung.</div>
<div class="verse00">Thus picture C&aelig;sar giving up the ghost</div>
<div class="verse00">Just when he reached the pinnacle, almost!</div>
<div class="verse00">Did Bonaparte receive his proper due?</div>
<div class="verse00">He <em>got</em> it, but too late, at Waterloo.</div>
<div class="verse00">He played with fire, aroused the seething crater,</div>
<div class="verse00">And now, with Nick, inhabits the Equator.</div>
<div class="verse00">So we conclude, delving the lines between,</div>
<div class="verse00">He might as well have clung to Josephine.</div>
<div class="verse00">Tho Tell's renown illumes the Alpine sky</div>
<div class="verse00">Whose target was the Apple of his eye,</div>
<div class="verse00">As much distinction, and applause to boot,</div>
<div class="verse00">Should be bestowed on William's steady <em>shoot</em>:</div>
<div class="verse00">More praise to him, than the Toxopholite,</div>
<div class="verse00">Who held the apple but eschewed a bite!</div>
<div class="verse00">The <em>worst</em> of us hath goodness in his breast;</div>
<div class="verse00">The <em>best</em> of us but fails, put to the test,&mdash;</div>

<div class="verse00">Until we're bankrupt or too spent to wrest</div>
<div class="verse00">Long hoped-for treasure from Mad Mammon's chest.</div>
<div class="verse00">Tho life hath ups and downs, the weeping willow</div>
<div class="verse00">Our ends shapes better than the downy pillow.</div>
<div class="verse00">It takes stern measures to incline the bantling,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">In right direction, without switch or scantling.</div>
<div class="verse00">The optimist with farthings in his pouch,</div>
<div class="verse00">Gets more enjoyment than the wealthy Grouch;</div>
<div class="verse00">Thus cheerfulness, a product underrated,</div>
<div class="verse00">In every household should be cultivated.</div>
<div class="verse00">Give me the man who, tho in direst straits,</div>
<div class="verse00">Will thumb his sharp proboscis at the Fates;</div>
<div class="verse00">Who'll take the flimsy fire escape, or dive</div>
<div class="verse00">Into the net, glad to get out alive;</div>
<div class="verse00">Who, tho the skies be unpropitious, crowds</div>
<div class="verse00">His way along, unmindful of the clouds;</div>

<div class="verse00">Beneath dark skies where vultures lay their course,</div>
<div class="verse00">To face the foe and ransom Liberty,</div>
<div class="verse00">Thru sacrificial offering of our sons;</div>
<div class="verse00">To arm and clothe five million men, and then</div>
<div class="verse00">Build, to convey and feed them, countless tons</div>
<div class="verse00">Of mighty vessels&mdash;transports, merchantmen;</div>
<div class="verse00">To furnish, in addition, vast supplies</div>
<div class="verse00">To allied Powers whose Cause we have embraced,</div>
<div class="verse00">To hearten them&mdash;to strengthen friendly ties</div>
<div class="verse00">And stay the hand that layeth Europe waste.</div>
<div class="verse00">A task indeed! But let it not be thought</div>
<div class="verse00">By foemen or by those whom we befriend</div>
<div class="verse00">That Liberty our trust, so dearly bought,</div>
<div class="verse00">Will not be guarded to the very end.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">Tho Hercules the Strong should heave in sight</div>
<div class="verse00">And challenge us to tests of thews and nerve,</div>
<div class="verse00">We'd enter the arena in our might</div>
<div class="verse00">And win new honors for the Land we serve;</div>
<div class="verse00">For Antaeus and all the myths of old</div>
<div class="verse00">'Gainst whom the supermen of yore engaged,</div>
<div class="verse00">Were never half so mighty, half so bold</div>
<div class="verse00">As peaceful freemen, righteously enraged:</div>
<div class="verse00">And all the modern Bullies who presume</div>
<div class="verse00">To dominate the world against the Right,</div>
<div class="verse00">Must see their day-dreams doomed to blackest gloom</div>
<div class="verse00">When Truth prevails against the Imps of Night.</div>
<div class="verse00">So let us fabricate in forge and mill;</div>
<div class="verse00">So let us plant and nurture grain and seed;</div>
<div class="verse00">So let us labor and conserve until</div>
<div class="verse00">There be an end to Kultur's cruel creed.</div>
<div class="verse00">Each one of us must fight or toil or save;</div>
<div class="verse00"><em>Co-ordination</em> be our battle song;</div>
<div class="verse00">Hardships endure and gravest dangers brave</div>
<div class="verse00">If we would victors be and right the wrong.</div>
<div class="verse00">God's ways to mortal eyes are not revealed,</div>
<div class="verse00">But Faith our guidance is thru War's grim task,</div>
<div class="verse00">And with His help the <em>Hosts of Sin</em> must yield</div>
<div class="verse00">And Satan be denuded of his mask.</div>

<div class="verse00">Go where the winds keep vigil o'er the trees,</div>
<div class="verse00">Rocking the tender saplings in the breeze;</div>
<div class="verse00">Go where the sunbeams play on rill and stream,</div>
<div class="verse00">Making the purling waters all agleam;</div>
<div class="verse00">Go where the birds rehearse their songs and trills</div>
<div class="verse00">In cool retreats, led by the Whippoorwills;</div>
<div class="verse00">Go where the bees, midst clover blooms, indulge</div>
<div class="verse00">Their honey habit till their bellies bulge;</div>
<div class="verse00">Go where the trout, in alder-arbored brooks,</div>
<div class="verse00">Abate their hunger but eschew the hooks;</div>
<div class="verse00">Go where the flowers, by fairy weavers spun,</div>
<div class="verse00">Pour out their grateful incense to the Sun;</div>
<div class="verse00">Go where the deer in secret nooks disport</div>
<div class="verse00">And Nature, clad in verdure, holds her Court;</div>
<div class="verse00">Go where&mdash;nay, stay! Yonder the artist stands,</div>
<div class="verse00">With brush and prismy palette in her hands,</div>
<div class="verse00">Before her easel, where the canvas seems</div>

<div class="verse00">That tint the dainty flowers and make the rose</div>
<div class="verse00">Blush to its sepals when it seeks repose;</div>
<div class="verse00">That tinge the moors and fields and turquoise sky,</div>
<div class="verse00">And stain the Autumn leaves with crimson dye!</div>
<div class="verse00">So tarry here, where moss and bluebells grow</div>
